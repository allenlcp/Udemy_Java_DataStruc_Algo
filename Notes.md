### Performance calculation
* Time complexity
* Memory complexity

Use worse case better than taking average

### Time complexity
* Number of desired sugars = n
* Total number of steps = 2n + 2
* As n grows, the number of steps grows
* The "2" in the 2n and the "+2" remain constant, so they don't factor into the time complexity. The value of n determines the growth rate.
* Time complexity is O(n) (big "O" notation)
* Linear time complexity 


### Big-O
| Big-O |
|---|---|
| O(1) | Constant |
| O(logn)  | Logarithmic |
| O(n) | Linear |
| O(nlogn) | n log-star n |
| O(n^2) | Quadratic |
